                            about design processes from the starting idea, its concept evolution till achievement of the 
                            end product. I firmly believe that a good process leads to good design and execution, Vignesh 
                            has encouraged and practiced every detail of this.

                            amazing sense of aesthetics. What is also very impressive about him is his ability to think 
                            from the userâ€™s perspective. Also, his work ethic and reliability was the only reason I kept 
                            going back to him for anything Design.
